# WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM INVENTORY DEV?

- Inventory developer isn't your personal developer, i dont help any thing except inventory. Just basic things (classes like)

- If you get any error firstly check you made everything right its written in ***ERRORS.md***

- Don't expect any error fixed from remote/personally, if you get any error with fully setup explain to inventory developer. I didn't fix bugs from remote.
